      <p>You are responsible for your own behavior, safety and welfare at Porchfest. Everyone remains individually responsible to conduct themselves under civil regulations of law and order. However, we have a few rules to help everyone enjoy themselves and maintain a safe environment for all:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pack it in, pack it out: please only leave footprints and take only pictures</li>
        <li>Follow all city ordinances in place</li>
        <li>Stay out of the city streets and remain safe, using all sidewalks and crosswalks</li>
        <li>Remember that the porches are actual homesteads: be respectful of our hostâ€™s property</li>
      </ul>
